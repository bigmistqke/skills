# Canon: lifetimes, with a logic layer

Six specs of pulse's lifetimes canon, each with the Alloy predicate that states it. The vocabulary below is the model they share, and the readings say it in words, so the statement of each spec is written from its predicate by `canon generate`.

Five of the specs have the id of a unit in pulse's own `CANON.md`, and say everything that unit says. The first, `disposing-an-owner-runs-its-cleanups`, is the example's own. It restates the sentence of pulse's `disposing-an-owner-ends-what-it-owns` about cleanups. It leaves out the effects and computeds that stop, and the signals that keep working. The spec about sub-owners is one of three sub-specs of pulse's `an-owner-disposes-its-children-before-its-own-cleanups`. The other two, about effects and computeds, are not modeled.

## @term teardown-model

> A teardown is the trace of what pulse does when it disposes an owner.

A teardown the specs must allow: a cleanup of an owner fails while pulse disposes the owner, and its error reaches the nearest error handler or boundary above the owner.

Disposing an owner is how its cleanups get their turn. When pulse disposes the owner, every cleanup that code has registered on it runs sooner or later, unless it has already run. Pulse leaves none behind.

```alloy
always all o: Owner, c: Cleanup |
  (dispose[o] and c in Registered and c.on = o and c not in Ran) implies eventually c in Ran
```

### @spec dispose-runs-once

> - now and at every later moment, there is no owner_2 such that code disposes owner_2 after pulse disposed it, and that call throws
<!-- statement-spec-dispose-runs-once:end -->

Disposing an owner a second time is harmless. When code disposes an owner that pulse has already disposed, the call runs none of its cleanups and does not throw.

```alloy
(always no c: Cleanup, o: Owner | runByCall[c, o])
and
(always no o: Owner | throwByCall[o])
```

<!-- statement-spec-owner-cleanups-run-newest-first-and-in-isolation:end -->

An owner's cleanups unwind like a stack: the one registered last runs first. Each runs in isolation, so a cleanup that fails does not stop the dispose.

```alloy
(always all o: Owner, c, d: Cleanup |
  (dispose[o] and c + d in Registered - Ran and c.on = o and d.on = o and c->d in Clock.older)
  implies ((not runNow[c]) until runNow[d]))
and
(always all o: Owner, c: Failing |
  (runNow[c] and c.on = o and o in Disposed) implies always o not in Stopped)
```

<!-- statement-spec-a-disposed-owner-cannot-be-entered:begin — generated by `canon generate`; edits are overwritten -->
> For every owner:

<!-- statement-spec-a-disposed-owner-cannot-be-entered:end -->

A disposed owner is finished. A call that tries to enter it throws at once.

```alloy
always all o: Owner | (enter[o] and o in Disposed) implies some Throwing'
```

<!-- statement-spec-an-owner-disposes-its-sub-owners-before-its-own-cleanups:end -->

An owner tears down from the inside out. Pulse disposes each of its children before it runs any cleanup registered on the owner, so a cleanup never finds a child still alive. The children go newest first, like the cleanups.

```alloy
(always all o, k: Owner, c: Cleanup |
  (dispose[o] and k.parent = o and k not in Disposed and c in Registered - Ran and c.on = o)
  implies ((not runNow[c]) until dispose[k]))
and
(always all o, j, k: Owner |
  (dispose[o] and j.parent = o and k.parent = o and j->k in Birth.order and j not in Disposed and k not in Disposed)
  implies ((not dispose[j]) until dispose[k]))
```

### @spec a-throwing-owner-cleanup-is-reported

> All of these hold:

>
>   then now or at a later moment, the error of failing_cleanup_2 has reached owner_3.
<!-- statement-spec-a-throwing-owner-cleanup-is-reported:end -->

A cleanup that throws while its owner is disposed does not make the dispose throw. Its error goes where errors go in pulse: to the nearest error handler or boundary above the owner.

```alloy
(always all o: Owner, c: Failing |
  (runNow[c] and c.on = o and o in Disposed) implies always o not in Threw)
and
(always all o, h: Owner, c: Failing |
  (runNow[c] and c.on = o and o in Disposed and o.handler = h) implies eventually c.reached = h)
```
